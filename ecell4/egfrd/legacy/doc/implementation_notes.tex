\section{Green's functions}


\subsection{Free Single}

Cartesian form:

\begin{equation}
p(\mathbf{r},t)=
\frac{1}{(4\pi Dt)^{\frac{3}{2}}}e^{-\frac{|\mathbf{r}|^{2}}{4Dt}}.
\end{equation}


In spherical coordinates:

\begin{equation}
  p(r,t|r_{0},t_{0}=0)=
  \frac{1}{(4\pi Dt)^{\frac{3}{2}}}
  e^{-\frac{r^{2}+r_{0}^{2}-2rr_{0}\cos(\theta)}
    {4Dt}}.
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Survival probability}

\begin{equation}
S(t)=1.
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Sampling $r$}

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{r}{2 \sqrt{Dt}}\right) 
- \frac{e^{-\frac{r^2}{4 D t}} r}{\sqrt{\pi D t}}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Sampling $\theta$}


\subsection{Single with an absorbing sphere}

We find the following in section 14.7 of C\&J (eq. 17 in page 366),
that is for the sphere $0 \geq r>a$ with an absorbing surface and
an unit instantaneous spherical surface source at $r=r_{0},t=0$;

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2\pi arr_{0}}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{Dn^{2}\pi^{2}t}{a^{2}}}\sin\frac{n\pi r}{a}\sin\frac{n\pi r_{0}}{a}.\end{equation}


The initial condition with a Dirac delta $\delta(r,t)$ corresponds to
taking the limit $r_{0}\rightarrow0$. Using 
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{r_{0}\rightarrow0}\left(\frac{a}{n\pi r_{0}}\sin\frac{n\pi
      r_{0}}{a}\right)=1,
\end{equation}
 we obtain the desired Green's function 
 \begin{equation}
   p_{1}(r,t)=\frac{1}{2a^{2}r}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n\, e^{-\frac{Dn^{2}\pi^{2}t}{a^{2}}}\sin\frac{n\pi r}{a}.
 \end{equation}


A conceptually identical equation can be found in eq (3.12) in \textit{Kalos
and Verlet 1974}. See also 9.3 (3) and (19) in C\&J.

Note the Jacobian in terms of $r$, $4\pi r^{2}$.


\subsubsection{Survival probability}

We want to calculate \begin{equation}
S(t)=\int_{0}^{a}4\pi r^{2}p_{1}(r,t)dr.\end{equation}


We get \begin{equation}
S(t)=-2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}e^{-\frac{Dn^{2}\pi^{2}t}{a^{2}}}.\end{equation}


Numerically, this series is not a good behaving one and does not converge
well. Using the fact that \begin{equation}
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{(n-1)}e^{-n^{2}w}=\frac{1}{2}(1-\vartheta_{4}(0,e^{-w})),\end{equation}
 where $\vartheta$ is Jacobi's theta, we rewrite $S(t)$ as \begin{equation}
S(t)=1-\vartheta_{4}(0,e^{-\frac{D\pi^{2}t}{a^{2}}}).\end{equation}
 Then we can efficiently evaluate this function through a product
representation \begin{equation}
\vartheta_{4}(0,q)=\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-q^{2n})(1-q^{(2n-1)})^{2}.\end{equation}



\subsubsection{Sampling $r$}

Unless we are somehow able to obtain an inverse function, one simple
but not awfully efficient way to sample $r$ is to use another integral
of $p_{1}(r,t)$, \begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{r'}4\pi r^{2}p_{1}(r,t)dr=\frac{2}{a\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-\frac{Dn^{2}\pi^{2}t}{a^{2}}}\left(a\sin\frac{n\pi r'}{a}-n\pi r'\cos\frac{n\pi r'}{a}\right)}{n}.\end{equation}


Using this, and eq. (6), with nonlinear programming, we find $r'$
so that 
\begin{equation}
   \mathcal{U}-\frac{\int_{0}^{r'}4\pi r^{2}p_{1}(r,t)dr}{S(t)}=0,
\end{equation}
 where $\mathcal{U}$ is a unit uniform random number.


\section{Main algorithm}

The main part of the implementation of EGFRD algorithm is described
in this section.  Here I avoided details and concentrated on basic
concepts, flows and schemes that should be useful to understand
the implementation.

\subsection{Pair implementation}

\subsubsection{Determining Next Event}

\paragraph{Determining $a_r$ and $a_R$}

Here we have some degrees of freedom in Pair parameters, such as how
to determine the ratio between $a_r$ and $a_R$ given certain size of
the shell.  The objective here is to maximize the probability for the
pair to react, not to escape either through the protective shells of
the CoM or the inter-particle vector.  If the pair is non-reactive, on
the other hand, we want to maximize the time to escape by setting
these two parameters.  To do a perfect job here can be as hard as 
solving some equations involving the Green's functions analytically.
However, the empirical strategy described below works reasonably
good in most cases.

We want to equalize the expected mean time for the CoM to escape
through $a_R$ and for the inter-particle vector to escape through
$a_r$.  To keep the problem handy, here we ignore the boundary
at $\sigma$.  Then, we can expect that the mean time for the CoM
and the inter-particle vector to arrive at the absorbing shell
are

\begin{eqnarray}
  \Delta t_r &=& \frac{a^{\{A,B\}}_r - r^{\{A,B\}}_0 - \sigma^{\{A,B\}}} 
  {\sqrt{D_{tot}}},\\
  \Delta t_R &=& \frac{a_R}{\sqrt{D_{CoM}}},
\end{eqnarray}
respectively, where ${\{A,B\}}$ is either $A$ or $B$, depending on which
one of the particles define the protective shell.


Use the following to set $a_R$ and $a_r$

\begin{eqnarray}
  a_R &=& \frac{\sqrt{D_{CoM}} 
    (D_A ( a - r_0 - \sigma_A ) + D_B (a - \sigma_A))}
  {(D_A {D_B}^5)^{1/4} + D_A( \sqrt{D_{CoM}} + \sqrt{D_{tot}})}, \\
  a_r &=& \frac{D_{tot} 
    (\sqrt{D_{CoM}} r_0 + \sqrt{D_{tot}} (a - \sigma_A))}
  {(D_A {D_B}^5)^{1/4} + D_A( \sqrt{D_{CoM}} + \sqrt{D_{tot}})},
\end{eqnarray}
when
\begin{math}
  ( D_A = D_B \wedge \sigma_A > \sigma_B ) \ \vee \ \\
  \left ( ( D_A > D_B ) \wedge a_r > a_{thr} \right ) \ \vee \
  \left ( ( D_A < D_B ) \wedge a_r < a_{thr} \right ), \\
  a_{thr} = \frac{( D_A + D_B ) (\sigma_B - \sigma_A)}{D_A - D_B},
\end{math}
that means the particle $A$ defines the Pair shell.  Otherwise,
\begin{eqnarray}
  a_R &=& \frac{\sqrt{D_{CoM}} 
    (D_B ( a - r_0 - \sigma_B ) + D_A (a - \sigma_B))}
  {({D_A}^5 D_B)^{1/4} + D_B( \sqrt{D_{CoM}} + \sqrt{D_{tot}})}, \\
  a_r &=& \frac{D_{tot} 
    (\sqrt{D_{CoM}} r_0 + \sqrt{D_{tot}} (a - \sigma_B))}
  {({D_A}^5 D_B)^{1/4} + D_B( \sqrt{D_{CoM}} + \sqrt{D_{tot}})},
\end{eqnarray}

When $D_A = D_B \wedge \sigma_A = \sigma_B$, the choice of shell-defining particle
doesn't make any difference.








\subsection{Handling the Squeezing Conditions}

When two particles are very close to each other, a Pair must be formed
to advance time.  However, the distance from the center-of-mass of the
Pair to the closest neighbor of this pair of particles is very close
to or is less than the minimum mobility radius of the pair, the Pair
can no longer hold, and the couple of particles is said to be 'squeezed'
by the closest neighbor of the Pair.

(FIXME: a figure here)

There are three types of methods in avoiding and handling the squeezing
conditions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item To avoid (or minimize the possibility of) squeezing in the first place.

\item To recover from a squeezing condition by displacing one or more
  particles in some arbitrary methods.

\item To allow squeezing to happen under some controlled conditions,
  watch influenced objects, and, when necessary, intervene the
  physical simulation in order to protect consistency of the simulator
  until the squeezing condition is dissolved.
\end{enumerate}

It is unclear if methods of type (1) that can avoid squeezing to
happen completely can be possible, thus this type of method shall be used in
conjunction with either (2) 'recovery' methods or (3) 'allow and
watch' methods.

Here I describe a type of 'allow and watch' methods that is included
in the implementation.
